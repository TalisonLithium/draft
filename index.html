								<p>Address issues with other mining operations in the region</p>
								<p>Systemic communication failures led to devasting loss of culturally significant assets.</p>
								<p>As Talison Lithium is expanding its mining operations, we are committed to firming up our social and environmental commitments to ensure that nothing like this will happen under our projects</p>
								<p><h2 class="major">Why Lithium?</h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lithium.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Lithium is a chemical element that has a range of uses in both chemical and technical applications. Lithium in various forms, such as lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and lithium chloride, is used in lubricant greases, pharmaceuticals, catalysts, air treatment and, particularly, in batteries — both non-rechargeable (primary) lithium metal batteries and rechargeable (secondary) lithium-ion batteries. </p>
								<p>Within the lithium battery sector, growth areas have been in batteries for portable electronic devices, such as mobile phones, computers and rechargeable power tools, as well as batteries and motors for electric bikes, hybrid and electric cars, and other vehicles. Demand for lithium in the electric vehicles segment is forecast to grow rapidly worldwide as major car manufacturers launch new models to secure market share. Various government subsidies and legislation on fuel emissions that promote a decreased reliance on fossil fuels and a cleaner environment are expected to encourage consumers to gradually move towards hybrid, plug-in hybrid or fully electric vehicles. Another potential growth area for lithium usage is for large-scale, grid-connected energy storage for electricity, although ultimate demand will depend on competing energy storage solutions. </p>
								<P>Considering that by 2050 electric vehicles are expected to comprise 31% of the Global Fleet, increases in battery demand for electric vehicles will be a strong driver of lithium consumption in the next decade.  In 2030, the global demand for lithium is expected to surpass two million metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, more than doubling the demand forecast for 2025. As the need for lithium increases, exploration will play a key role in unlocking new sources of production.</P>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/projection.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In a 2050 projection from the World Bank, lithium demand in supplying each energy technology is expected to increase by 965%</p>
								<h3 class="major">Jobs and opportunities</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This project will bring increased population, younger demographics and higher wages. Residents will have an awareness for and access to diverse work opportunities, with jobs ranging from technical trades jobs in the mine to environmental workers overseeing the sites. And they will be well-paid. In 2020, workers in resources were paid 55 per cent above the national average at $143,022 (Minerals Council of Australia).</p>
								<h3 class="major">Community-group benefits</h3>
								<p>Talison Lithium will contribute significantly to social and community groups and not-for-profits. We are highly aware of our responsibility to regional communities. We will have local purchasing and procurement strategies in place to boost the local economic benefits. At Talison Group, we choose to support community groups in all the regions where we develop our mining activities.</p>
								<p>Visit the <a href="#community">Community</a> section to know how you can engage with us</p>
								<h3 class="major">Local services and infrastractures</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/infrastructure.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In Australia, Talison Lithium supports communities through partnerships and engagement. We are aware of our social responsibilities with the regional communities where our mining activities take place, which is why we have local purchasing and spending goals. We invest in the development of local roads, road maintenance, sewerage systems, hospitals, and schools in regions where we carry out our mining activities.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Social impact management</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/socialimpact.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Talison Lithium is aware of historical impacts, such as boom and bust cycles and insufficient housing. When developing projects in Western Australia, we undertake a Social Impact Assessment to scope the potential impacts. During this process potential benefits are appraised, and attempts made to increase them, while negative consequences are mitigated and minimised.</p>

						<!-- Sustainability -->
							<article id="sustainability">
								<h2 class="major">Environment and planning</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/environment.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Talison Lithium has the responsibility and desire to operate safely, sustainably and responsibly. Our focus on economic, social and environmental sustainability guides our actions. We are complying requirements under environmental approvals and will conduct monitoring of groundwater and endangered species on site. Ahead of mining operations commencing, we are already planning for land rehabilitation using best-practice methods. We will also conduct weed and fire management.</p>
								<p>The functionality of Talison Lithium company has passed the requirements for International Standards ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System and ISO 14001:2014 Environmental Management System. These two significant qualifications have been audited by an external organization named BVQI. The following are some of Talison Lithium's major environmental responsibilities at the Greenbushes Lithium operations: </p>
									<li><a href="#rehab">Mined land rehabilitation and replication to restore a self-sustaining native forest <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ecology.</a></li>
									<li><a href="#water">Maintaining the quality of local water resources in the Blackwood Valley Catchment.</a></li>
									<li><a href="#monitor">Environmental monitoring as required by the company's operating permit.</a></li>
									<li><a href="#waste">Minimising waste by reducing, reusing, and recycling as much as feasible.</a></li>
									<li><a href="#control">Control and reporting emissions including dust and noise.</a></li>
									<li><a href="#offset">Offset habitat to replace habitat lost because of mining operation.</a></li>
									<br>
								<h4 id="rehab">Rehabilitation of mined land to re-establish a <br>self-sustaining, native forest ecosystem</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/terra.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Rehabilitation involves initial earthworks to reform the landscape, application of a 'topsoil' layer, followed by ripping and contouring to improve drainage and promote root growth. Available rocks, logs or forest litter are spread to provide habitat for local fauna.</p>
								<p>Talison has a programme of progressive rehabilitation of waste rock landform and tailings storage facilities which is scheduled to coincide with available rehabilitation materials and equipment. Progressive rehabilitation has significant benefits which include early establishment of vegetation, which reduces dust levels and improves visual surroundings.</p>
								<p>Efforts to carry out rehabilitation at the lithium operations run by Talison have been recognised by receiving a "Golden Gecko" in 2016. This award recognises outstanding environmental achievements in the Western Australian resource industry.</p>
								<h4 id="water">Ensuring the quality of local water resources are maintained</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/water.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Water for mineral processing is sourced from rainfall and stored in several process water dams, and mining voids located on the site. Conservation of water is a high priority and process water is recovered and recycled. To ensure that surface water quality is maintained, measurement and reporting of water quality parameters in key water bodies is carried out on a weekly basis. Ground water monitor bores are located around the process plants and tailing dams and are monitored on a quarterly basis.</p>
								<p>During the mining processes of blasting, crushing and grinding of ore, naturally occurring elements such as lithium minerals are liberated into the water. Talison is constructing a Water Treatment Facility to remove these elements before re-use (recycling) or discharge.</p>
								<h4 id="monitor">Minimising the spread of weeds on site in accordance with an Integrated Weed Management Plan</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/weed.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Our aim is to prevent weeds setting seeds, or vegetatively reproducing, so that the weed population is reduced over time, reducing weed competition and preserving the natural environment. Talison Lithium employs a full time weed control officer and uses a variety of mechanical, biological and chemical methods to manage weeds at the Greenbushes Lithium Operations.</p>
								<h4 id="waste">Waste minimisation, employing a policy of reduce, reuse and recycle wherever possible</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/recycle.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Talison Lithium recognises its responsibility to protect the environment by minimising waste and has a long term strategy to reduce the amount of waste generated. The strategy aims to:</p>
								<li>Reduce solid waste going into landfill</li>
								<li>Re-use potential waste materials whenever possible</li>
								<li>Minimise packaging waste</li>
								<br>
								<h4 id="control">Emissions control and reporting</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sound.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Greenbushes Lithium Operations will be located in a rural area and proximity to a township will demand a strong commitment to the management of mine site emissions including dust and noise.</p> 
								<p>Talison Lithium will instal a noise monitoring station which will be located on the sound wall between the mining areas and the town of Greenbushes. Noise will be monitored continuously at this location and recording of noise “events” are collected. This data will be reviewed daily to ensure compliance with regulation levels.</p>
								<p>Dust monitoring will be also carried out to ensure compliance with license conditions. Dust management strategies at the Greenbushes Lithium Operations will include:</p>
									<li>Monitoring current and forecast wind conditions using daily forecasts and real time <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp wind speed and direction monitoring data to minimize off-site emissions as a result  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp of blasting, construction and operations.</li>
									<li>Baghouse and scrubber system on driers to reduce particulates in stack emissions.</li>
									<li>Seeding accessible areas of tailings storage facilities with annual grasses or use of  <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp dust suppression products on exposed surfaces as required.</li>
									<li>Management of tailings discharge lines to ensure moisture is maintained on exposed <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp areas.</li>
									<li>Visual inspections for dust generation on a regular basis.</li>
									<li>Use of additional dust control measures where practical (eg a dust binding agent) <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and applying water and using dust suppressing chemicals on stockpiles.</li>
									<li>Ensuring all contractors and staff undertake induction which include raising <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp awareness of the importance of dust control.</li>
									<li>Ongoing consultation with stakeholders to determine the success of the dust <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp management measures.</li>
									<li>Ensuring dust monitoring is undertaken and the results reviewed.</li>
									<li>Suspending work in a particular area or for a nominated activity as deemed <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp necessary. </li>
									<li>Applying progressive rehabilitation techniques to minimize exposed areas.</li>
									<br>
								<h4 id="offset">Providing Offset habitat to replace any habitat impacted by the mine's operations</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bird.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Talison Lithium has been characterized by its commitment to caring for ecosystems and the living beings that make them up. One example of this was the partnership with local Blackwood Basin Group to create a wetland haven for wading birds at Schwenke’s Dam, an historic mining void created from tin and tantalum production in the 1950s and 1960s. The four- year project, completed in 2017, has resulted in the creation of a wetland habitat with low key recreational facilities for the community including walk trails, boardwalk and interpretive signage. We are committed to saving the habitat of the species that inhabit the region.</p>
